2. Something was wrong with the formatting in the liking Excel-file (empty rows were considered
as if they had data in them). CC reported in Data tab that there were > 16 000 rows. 
==> try to solve problem by saving file in text format. 
* Strangely, also text produced problems (ValueError: new type not compatible with array) (Arcus liking.txt) 
* Solved problem by copy-paste of only data into new file. (Arcus liking_2.txt)
