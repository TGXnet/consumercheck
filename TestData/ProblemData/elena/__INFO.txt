Problem 1:
Nordic letters in the Yoghurt_senory.txt file. Because of this no file loads.
Should implement loading of those files that are actually ok. Not ok to drop import file that otherwise
would import nicely as it is now.

Problem 2:
X'X problem as seen before. Hopefully fixed in Alexandras new code.
